## 📋 Executive Summary

**Creative Asset Validator** is a comprehensive, browser-based creative intelligence platform designed for marketing teams, agencies, and enterprises. It validates, organizes, and optimizes advertising creative assets across 50+ platforms—all without requiring any backend infrastructure.

### Why This Exists

> *"In the fast-paced world of digital advertising, a single wrong-sized creative can mean thousands in wasted ad spend, missed campaign windows, and frustrated clients."*

Every day, creative teams waste hours:
- ❌ Manually checking if assets meet platform specifications
- ❌ Creating countless resizes for 50+ advertising platforms
- ❌ Tracking which clients need what formats
- ❌ Searching through chaotic folder structures for that one logo file
- ❌ Missing brand guidelines and compliance requirements

**We built the solution.** A platform that empowers creative teams to work smarter, faster, and with complete confidence.
